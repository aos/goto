## Goto

The idea behind this is that I often jump around between very nested
directories and it would be nice to have some shortcut to do that. There are
already existing tools that do this, but as an exercise I wanted to roll my
own.

This is still not functional, the last piece remaining is to add the shell
extension that allows for actually changing directories. [See here for more
details.](goto.go#L41)
